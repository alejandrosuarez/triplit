# Triplit in the browser

Triplit is the embedded database designed to run in any JavaScript environment, including the browser. Almost every developer will use Triplit in the browser through the `TriplitClient` client library. Read more about the `TriplitClient` in the [client library documentation](/client).

## Supported storage options

### Memory

The memory storage option is the default storage option for the `TriplitClient`. It stores all data in memory and is not persistent. This means that all data will be lost when the page is refreshed or closed.

### IndexedDB

To persist data in the browser, you can use the `indexeddb` storage option in the `TriplitClient`. This will store all data in the browser's IndexedDB database. By default, the `TriplitClient` will cache all data in memory for fast access. If you want to disable this, you can set the `cache` option to `false` when creating the `TriplitClient`. Read more about IndexedDB storage configuration in [the client library documentation](/client/storage#indexeddb).

## Example

```typescript
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';

const client = new TriplitClient({
  storage: 'indexeddb',
  token: '<your token>',
  serverUrl: 'https://<project-id>.triplit.io',
});
```
