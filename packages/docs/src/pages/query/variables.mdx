# Variables

Variables in Triplit allow you to pass in preset values into queries. They consist of a scope (to prevent collisions) and a dot (`.`) separated path to reference data in the variable.

## Types of variables

### Query variables

Query variables are prefixed with the `query` scope and are accessible just to the query they are defined on. They are defined with the `Vars` method in the query builder. For example:

```typescript
const baseQuery = client.query('employees').Where([
  ['team', '=', 'Delivery Crew'],
  ['name', '=', '$query.name'],
]);
const fryQuery = baseQuery.Vars({ name: 'Philip J. Fry' });
const leelaQuery = baseQuery.Vars({ name: 'Turanga Leela' });
```

This can help prevent writing the same query multiple times with different values. Additionally, you can use query variables to open [selective public access](/schemas/permissions#modeling-selective-public-access) to resources, allowing you to create things like public links to private resources.

### Global variables

Global variables are prefixed with the `global` scope and are accessible to all queries in the database. They are defined in the client constructor or via the `updateGlobalVariables` method. For example:

```typescript
const client = new TriplitClient({ variables: { name: 'Philip J. Fry' } });
let query = client.query('employees').Where('name', '=', '$global.name'); // resolves to 'Philip J. Fry'

client.db.updateGlobalVariables({ name: 'Turanga Leela' });
query = client.query('employees').Where('name', '=', '$global.name'); // resolves to 'Turanga Leela'
```

### Token variables

Token variables are prefixed with the `token` scope and are accessible to all queries in that database session. When [authenticating](/auth) with a Triplit server, the server will assign all claims on the JWT to token variables.

### Role variables

When determining access control rules with [roles](/schemas/permissions#roles), you can use role variables to reference values from a client's token in your permission definitions. Role variables are prefixed with the `role` scope.

## Accessing variables

`$global` and `$token` variables are accessible on the client instance through the `vars` property.

```typescript
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';
const client = new TriplitClient({
  variables: { name: 'Philip J. Fry' },
  token: '<jwt-token>',
});
console.log(client.vars.$global.name); // Philip J. Fry
console.log(client.vars.$token.sub); //  The subject of the JWT token, if it exists
```
